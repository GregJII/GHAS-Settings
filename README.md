# GHAS-Settings

The provided code offers an automated solution tailored for enterprise networks, specifically designed to extract and consolidate security and analysis settings from GitHub's Security Coverage pages. By leveraging Playwright and BeautifulSoup libraries, the script enables secure login to GitHub within enterprise networks, ensuring data privacy and compliance. It creates a new CSV file with descriptive column headers to accommodate the security-related information. Through web scraping techniques, the code extracts vital details such as repository names, Dependabot setup status, Code Scanning configuration, and Secret Scanning setup, enhancing visibility into the security posture of the enterprise's repositories. Leveraging the power of the GitHub API, the script retrieves advanced security and secret scanning push protection information for each repository, delivering a comprehensive overview of their security status. The resulting CSV file serves as a valuable resource for enterprise network administrators, empowering them to efficiently assess and manage security measures across their repositories in a centralized manner, supporting a robust security framework within the enterprise network environment.
